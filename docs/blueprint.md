## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC) for a calm, neutral base.
- Background color: Light gray (#FAFAFA), a shade of the primary color.
- Accent color: muted teal (#70A1AF), approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of beige (which has a slightly yellow / greenish undertone). Its muted nature keeps the palette soft, as the user requested.
- Code syntax highlighting colors: Mimic Visual Studio Code theme with shades of blue, green, yellow, and red for different code elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. The combination is clean and modern.
- Subtle animations for hover effects and scrolling transitions.
- Clean and modern layout with clear sections for projects, skills, and contact information.
- Use simple, consistent icons for skills and project categories.
